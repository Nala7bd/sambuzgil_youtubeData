The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels. Just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so will it be at the end of the age. The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all law-breakers, and throw them into the fiery furnace.

But in the question the closest value was asked so i think 2.1 can be assumed correct  as 2.2 wasn't there in the options || AKASH RAJ - Sir your explanation is correct but what happen if all winding are winded in same direction the resultant flux will be 0 hence no induced emf in any winding but in some books we have read that if 3 phase winded on same core there will not be any induced emf in that case also kvl not satisfied plz explain sir ? || Piyush Joshi - theek hai! || surendra reddy - transformers question is absolutely correct.
Don't try to blame IIT || Mohit Chaturvedi - Stop miss guiding students. Your logic is absolutely rubbish , though that phaser Mathod just by reversal is also wrong. Correct and will be 46 only by calculating flux/mms first then EMF. || jogesh pradhan - Mera 23 volt aya hai || Techspecial Information - Proper procedure to solve Zunsat when occ curve doesn't start from origin is that , calculate rated armature current, find out field current require for rated armature current from SCC curve.

(⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️)
 This was god damn amazing the beginning of this match was great the middle of it was awesome hell that end was just plain awesome I was Cedric got illuminated  was holy shit crazy and I almost  thought that  Dolph won  and I won’t spoil it happens after the match but oh my god that was crazy  || Chilly Willy - THe show opener as an a bomb; I like the part where dolly got speared through the glass. I also think you did a good job on dolph interfearing with punk. But I think it would’ve been cool if punk returned with bolt cutters to ruin dolphs chances on winning and stealing the championship for himself. The KO and Murphy match I really enjoyed because, of the unique backstage area, With the scaffolding, that area where Murphy climbed up to, and the can that Murphy was thrown onto. But when’s KO went for a frog splash on Murphy. The way the can was dented would’ve made KOs knees and upper chest hit the edges. Then, I liked the run in by Kane and Braun, I also really liked that face mask the Braun wore. Then in the 2nd chamber I wished Kenny didn’t retain his championship because then 2/2 chambers ended up not doing anything except fo giving us one hell of matches. I though it would’ve been cool if Adam Cole made a sort of friendship with the Wyatt cult, not like him joining the cult, just kinda of them being connected in some way. I’m very surprised there were only 4 matches, even if the were all above 30 min. Long. Overall the best POV you have put on except for 2 or 3 mishaps here and there. || Videntures 27 - Contains spoilers  || CoreyyH - What a show seths attire was amazing and balor and balor club has arrived and returned you killed it !!! || OOF Wagon - 9:10

Sorry for the loss Rip Allie || Tank Taylor - I love Murphy vs Kevin you should maybe do a new championship like a MDT Undisputed Championship and have a tournament for the title 10/10 great show I also love the first elimination chamber. It was great and when 
Contains Spoilers || knicksyanks - 10/10 show. Wish you could have booked the real elimination chamber. The booking was amazing, the matches were amazing, the recording was amazing, and the commentary was amazing. Glad you took your time with this so we could get the best of what could come out. Can't wait for MyDamnNation. Amazing ending to the show with the return of Finn Balor and the Balor Club. || TheMemever Guy - This show was a 10/10, my first show and holy cow.

There are two correct options
Both NO- and MeCH 2- can act as the 4 electron donor ligands as the bridging ligands. H- and CO both can act as the 2 electron donor as the bridging ligand. For NO- the 2 lone pairs on the sp2 nitrogen are used for bridging the metal centers. For H- 3c-2e Ru-H-Ru bridge bond occurs. Thus the correct ans are NO- and H- and MeCH 2- and CO to satisfy the 18 e rule. But the published ans key only gives 1 option (C) MeCH 2- and CO. Candidates can challenge the ans. || Lata Lata - Nice || ARIJIT GHOSH - Sir carborane is Nido. But smiple borane is closo. || Chem Light - Bhai question me Ru nhi Rh hai"

I spent 40 years collapsing one within with so many characters and the victim can go into great depression without full recovery and detachments.of course different hierarchical scripts determines the environment and how much and how difficult to destroy it. The victims are often humiliated and battled for a jumber of years and your mental strength to get through the shame and embarrassment facing within 3 D  public often attracts people talking about u. U can either get into a retaliation mode and absolve into those culture or u can go into hangman mode and start using your intuition of what to do next. The spread betweeb events often requies one to go in and out of situations and suck your pride to get deep into the spying mode and feel in advance what the future events will be and providing alternatives for yourself to acieve the objected outcome f of putting in timed bombs.

If a rich person fears for his children's future, then there is trouble coming...So, Cooper should have asked, what prompted Gates to say that comment originally. || D L - to your question - I believe big part of the US being worse off (in spite of your resources) is because of mindset, an overly narrow interpretation of the concept of freedom and the illusion that a social society is contradictory with individual 'success' and 'interest' ... that together with cultivated overconfidence, widespread poor education, social inequality and restricted world awareness ... || sistaschin - Who asked Bill what he thinks and who appointed him to make health decisions for us? || Mr.Badluck - Bill gates didn't predicted. More like planned || oskar oskarssson - These interviews are is directed. Coopoer give no sharp questions, He act like he is soooo serious even though he already know the answers. || Michigan USA/Singapore S.E.Asia - He has an investment in the vaccine industry.

Gold - bro who raised hand when he said i listened to you! stanning to hard || Mensura Beautiful - Dear god help us all !! || Joyce Bandele - Who’s the doctor here, I’m confused. || Rodrigo Dutardo - Predicted or caused it?
But the real story is that while polio has statistically disappeared from India, there has been a huge spike in cases of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP)– the very types of crippling problems it was hoped would disappear with polio but which have instead flourished from a new cause. || charles hughes - This is biological warfare. || John Madsen - With all his resources and he did nothing. He is a terrible person. Or more likely, his very very general ted talk was absolutely not a prediction. 
Because if he really did know the future.... evil evil person does nothing with his massive resources. || Marie - ""The health experts including myself??""....since when did Bill Gates become a health expert? || Denise Alex - All of them need to be in jail for Treason!!!!!!

He’s creepy and untrustworthy. We all need to stop looking up to these wealthy people put on a pedestal. Why would this guy be giving all this medical advise and the world following any of his direction? What in the world has happened especially to our country? This video here just makes me and many others, I’m sure, even more uncomfortable with Gates and Fauci. I don’t believe there’s anything Gates can say to make me feel any different. 👎 || D Paul - “955-995k” test a day, I am sure would do American citizens tons of justification (Mr.Gates). || Rodrigo Dutardo - Gill gates said 700,000 injuries from his covid vaccine is acceptable. Remember that when he pushes his medical facism on you: || Andrew Scotton - Total tests mean NOTHING.  Its about every week! || Mark Oppuse - When did Gates become authority on vaccines?

And I believe Cooper is on that list as well. 🙏 Bless the children. Lord save us all || Claudine Schultz - I predicted the pandemic when I had the legionnaires flu yrs ago  & again with the ebola ..  Gates probably knows little more than any healthnut.  This is insane since no one living person can speak with experience. Yet are treated as if they are experts because they are monied or popular, 
We need to wake up to the facts tiihat China wasn't honest about the virus.  The count of patients is  off in nursing homes & hospitals, If an elderly person dies of anything , it will be counted as cv-virus, even if they die of something else, it is not being diagnosed by tests or autopsy.   It's easier & pays better plus fits the dnc agenda More tha few personnel have told reporters & others.   || JJzoomerbear - Hmmm he’s got something special in that shot for you 😈 || John Matthews - Prediction or new my guess its the later look at the friends he keeps and funds so much into these things he  will have half the worlds vaccine surplise 💉💰💰💰💰💰💰💰 very evil man  i think . || DasEichenlaub - Planning and predicting are two different things || randomblackguy95 - ""predicted it""?! is gates nostradamus or a prophet now?

The real issue here is why the world governments failed so miserably and how we avoid this from happening again. One way to avoid it is to change the way society operates. And yes, that’s the society bill gates and his fellow capitalistic friends helped shape. || Mohamed Abdullahi - I was gonna say, why are we asking for advice from a guy who sells computers? Next up a gas station clerk on how we might be opening up the country || Dere R. - God is our savior || Lakha Sankar - Excuse me....but is he a doctor of any kind??? || Heidi Hernandez - It wouldn't surprise me if Bill gates and a fee others had something to do with this pandemic.

GATES, ITALY'S GOVERNMENT IS (LOOKING FOR YOU) TO BE INDICTED FOR THE COORDINATED VIRUS HOAX KILLING MILLIONS.
#TRUMP2020#MAGA🇺🇸#4MREYRS || Cheryl Herrera - From my information, both Bush and Obama did address the issue of pandemics and provided safety measures and plans that were removed by Trump administration.  Before Trump, @CDC had people on the ground in China and other nations constantly in order to follow chatter about viruses.  Trump administration allowed this to happen. || David Mccully - Eugenicist || Clemenza Schwarz - Time to shed your skin, Billie boy, for you're looking pretty wrinkled from the outside, while your underneath's comming out much more to the surface... || Ibrahim Al-Dossary - The new medicine of COVID-19 will reduce of world pollution and do not expect better situation from Bill Gates. He said that in his speech for expectation about the virus and more danger than nuclear BOOM  and he was wright when he said  the world is not ready.

If you want to listen to someone who is 'rich' & who actually is a doctor,
then listen to Michael J. Burry on the Covid-19 lockdowns in the 'Citizen' - well worth reading ! 
I will also certainly listen to Swedish Epidemiologist Professor Johan Giesecke : - ""Why Lockdowns Are The Wrong Policy."" || Daisy Wood - where is the proof your an expert GATES || james morton - software weenies sound smart, what has he done ?  go up against trump ?   no || Erin lee Hendricks - Can you belief that cnn new dr  dr bil  gates not even completing his college what a joke || Jay Motivate - Created & Predicted are two different things || Sebastián Lambert - So, Israel is a legitimate state? || L M - Interesting...he just said ""Deaths are down""...that is good...this is hopeful. The more people exposed...means more immunity to Covid...could it be we're getting closer to herd immunity?
We do far more testing than other countries...yet our deaths are down...hmmm.
 Bill, let me ask, do you and Dr. faucci benefit from those vaccines? || Big Rikki - Bill gates manages three this disease and already own patent to cure it.

To sell the vaccine || Farrah Tuafono - I love you Anderson Cooper ❤️💋 || G M X - Bill gates will profit from pandemic.. || Matt S - Only way to solve this is to find out where Bill Gates is, and take him out, and all the other NWO supporting elitists.

Crimes against humanity || Alpha Ebenezer - He only predicted what he and his associates planned! Prophet Bill freaking Gates! || R Long - I have a couple questions that should be considered very important for all of us to know.
one is Why the media doesn’t ask Bill Gates about the practice drill for Covid19 he ran months prior to the public even knowing ANYTHING about COVID-19?
Two Is how he claims the research and studies prove the vaccines don’t cause autism if they have not done any safety or affective studies on vaccines in over 32 years? is how he claims the research and studies prove the vaccines don’t cause autism if they have not done any safety or affective studies on vaccines in over 32 years?  || muntazir zia - 2:43 Bill completely dodges that question(they wanted him to talk about trump) || CD Perez - Bill's ""depopulate the planet by 10 percent thru Vaccines "" video is a good one as well || Amish Cabins - Bill gates must be a doctor || randy tabron - Did him and China make it what I think now wants people to have his vaccine no way any thing him and China touch I have no need for || Brett Bayford - What I think is, especially considering all the speculation of Bill Gates starting the epidemic is that no one in general population can have the meds or vaccine, too much bin trash needs to be wiped off the earth no left or right about straight up mass culling || Rizzo Cizzo - Say ahhhhhhhhhh !!!!! || william burford sr - Of course he predicted the Virus......He had a major hand in covid-19 combine with the W.H.O.  and Communist China. || Chulo Escobar - He didn't predicted they made it || coa lakmi - this is just sick to play with whole world and lie ... sick ... || Marie Bowser - Bill Gates please take your vaccine || Revolved Silence - Bill Gates.🤔... the guy who's been praying for a pandemic for years... telling us that we need to do more?

I’d like an expert to break down his reaction. He knew too much. || Skeeter Davis - Watergate, Russia gate now Bill gate || Bob Loblaw - # of cases is irrelevant, especially knowing the ""outbreak"" is happening within the younger crowd, which almost NEVER results in hospitalization and/or death-just like the flu. US COVD deaths-per-1 million individuals is the ONLY IMPORTANT STATISTIC. In June, 2020 US number was 327. Belgium was 825, UK-641, Spain-606, Italy-573, Sweden-502, France-442 and so on. We were much better than almost every similar-sized European country and no country has our diversity. It was summer in Southern Hemisphere when virus began, so numbers were low-for now. CDC reported 60,000+ deaths from influenza (which is also referred to as coronavirus) in 2018-19. CDC predicted a record outbreak of influenza in US and worldwide for 2019-20 and announced that over 10 million cases were recorded in Jan., 2020.

Something doesn't sounds right here from a man who want population control.. || Lydia Ogoti - This is the reason I stopped watching CNN. Allowing liars to continuously fool and blind the public. What business does an I.T. Businessman got to do with discussing subjects that are not his domain apart from having invested heavily in the pharmaceutical companies. Anyways whether I voice my view on this forum or not, he is smiling all the way to the bank as we continue to suffer from the effects of this pandemic. I wish I heard him say I am giving ten percent of my money to people of whom have lost jobs for the next ten years...ha! It'd rain chocolate muffins || GOD'S CHOSEN - Not a prediction...PLAN!!!! PLANDEMIC!!! || Eugene Vaux - The reason? It's our religious extremists' best opportunity to MAKE IT SEEM LIKE a biblical plague, thus FRIGHTENING Americans into serving their church. || Duran Bell - he gets a 20 to 1 return on vaccine investments and he’s invested over 10 billion || Q Rm - Of course he perdicted it.

Bill Gates. || Paul Mc Carron - Bit of a giggler isnt he... physcopath || Kay B - Why is he saying “ahhhhh” between every other word?? Sound like he’s  “ahhhhh” lying ! 😡.

He wasn't directly answering their questions. || Seamonkies321 - To the anti mask people
Please don't forget to inform your surgeon to remove their masks if you or anyone in your family ever need surgery because according to your logic masks are ineffective at protecting you or anyone else against germs. || askel douglas - My question is it man made cronavirus.question two why were they talking about cronavirus in 2006 .Question how control the vaccine will be the RICHES person on this planet .what if there is other way to cure it would you want to know ok . || Catspiracy Theorist - Your video title is wrong fakestream news, CNN, it should be retitled as ""BILL GATES PLANNED THE SCAMDEMIC. HEAR HIS DEMANDS NOW."" || Mike Gall - I'm honestly afraid of him and his wife.  They are something straight out of a Horror movie.  If you notice he never gets mad or argues or raises his voice with ppl, and smiles a lot.  These sound like good traits but he will stay level headed and smile the whole time he wipes out 20% of the population! || mark raven - Larry, Curley and Moe || Avis Tumpkin - We all seen COVID-19 over in China.

But the real story is that while polio has statistically disappeared from India, there has been a huge spike in cases of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP)– the very types of crippling problems it was hoped would disappear with polio but which have instead flourished from a new cause. || Paul Hamill - Community circulation is the big danger. WHO have since endorsed wearing masks in preparation for what's ahead in the fall. Only then will the reality be realized.

Bill Gates is already getting back lashes from the world. Gupta should be talking this way, he's the doctor, and he ain't believable either. He couldn't get a word in. Gates is really involved in this whole covid-19,  prediction scam and the people are waking up and  recognizing it. CNN, I don't know what the hell y'all doing, going along for the ride, I'm a big fan of CNN too, for a short period of time . || David Jones - Dr. Gates is speaking....

Event201. Id2020. Agenda21. Agenda30. || Udo C.-M. - My opinion he is a very dangerous man this Gates || JA Douglas - Imagine being Bill Gates right now.
You spend 30 years of your life and $50 billion of your own dollars supporting humanitarian causes. You directly save hundreds of thousands of lives in South East Asia by providing anti malaria netting to half of a continent, you drop infant mortality rates throughout the entire developing world by funding vaccine programs including vaccinating 40,000,000 children for polio, and, amongst a plethora of philanthropic endeavors, you fund free educational platforms like Khan Academy so people can have free access to high quality education. || Diane Young - The Federal government needs to provide supplies to states in order to test all these cases and also order manufacturers to make  PPE for healthcare workers who desperately need them in this crisis. || BTsMusicChannel - Exactly who we need to hear from right now, the neo-feudal overlord, a de facto government in himself who should have redistributed his resources to prepare for the problem identified, Bill Gates.

This is the Apocalypse, and what i mean by that is the origin of that word.
ORIGIN

Old English, via Old French and ecclesiastical Latin from Greek apokalupsis, from apokaluptein ‘uncover, reveal’, from apo- ‘un-’ + kaluptein ‘to cover’. || follow thelord - His devil horn is popping out again. I cant believe CNN is still on.. they should all wear masks... I mean muzzles!!! || Toni L. - He sounds like he’s mincing his words. Tippy Toeing around criticizing this administration. What is his connection with Individual 1 again? || umakanth balachandran - If u do more testing u find more cases that's normal. Camper to other countries u.s. death rate very Low. Under the president Trump leadership he save many Americans 
BUT media don't like truths that's very sad. || Shawn Fellows - @Anderson Cooper @Bill Gates have either of you purchased from Jeffrey Epstein? I have seen physical presence of Bill Gates with Jeffrey Epstein, so that is very suspect. I haven't seen that with Anderson Cooper, but why does he ignore Bill's connection with Jeffrey Epstein? He obviously knows Bill Gates interacted with Jeffrey Epstein after he was convicted of trafficking children. Why is Cooper treating Bill Gates as an expert on COVID-19? Bill has also said that we can reduce the population if we do a really great job with vaccines, healthcare and reproductive health services. || Mike Stokes - Aaaaaahhhhhhhhhh, how can the guys aaaaahhhhh on the outside  aaaahhhh  keep a straight face.  How can anybody believe these lies. || ange daniel zue - Hey gates, when are going to invest your billions in order to eradicate homelessness in america ?

Release a virus then give the cure at a ""COST"". WE JUST CAN'T HAVE PEACE. || David Holburn - Seasonal and the weather is helping us. So take vitamin d and zinc??? Since it only really affects the old and those with underlying issues. Saying zmerica done the worst??? They have the most ventilators, most testing in the planet.....this video just proves its the democrats playing this game. Gates should be investigated!!! || Desperado Shao - Yes, wearing a mask is political corrects in the USA so people don't wear it,
while wearing a mask is political corrects in China as well, so people wear it. || Cristina D - He didn't predict...he create the virus.....and CNN and mass media must be closed forever. || C J - America (USA): the most conspiratorial country in the world,.. 
(comments in here) || Noriel de Leon - I don't know about you people who believe this guy...common sense dictates that the reason he was able to predict the pandemic is because him, Dr. Fauci and the other people of their kind  are the ones behind this C19... || Satyanarayana Guda - Economics is behaviour, intent and quality of ruling ministers. I will take a small example of AP/TELANGANA STATES WHICH I BELONG TO. THESE STATES SPEND MONEY ON SEVERAL SOCIAL WELFARE SCHEMES. THESE ARE THE DAYS OF DEADLY CORONA WHICH ACTUALLY CALLS FOR HEALTH AND ECONOMIC EMERGENCY. THERE FREE MONEY SCHEMES LIKE RYTHI BHAROSA/RYTHU BANDHU, AMMAVODI SO ON AND SO FORTH. THESE ARE GO9D SCHEMES OR NOT IS IS MY DEBATE OR QUESTION. THE AMOUNT SPENT ON THESE SCHEMES (FREE CASH TRANSFERS/DBT) IS ABOUT 15000 CRORE RUPEES PER STATE PER YEAR. A WISE AND RESPONSIBLE GOVT/POLITICAL PARTY (RULING) WOULD HAVE SUSPENDED THESE FOR ONE YEAR AND ESTABLISHED CORONA ERADICATION MISSION. THIS WOULD HAVE SERVED TO ERADICATE CORONA IN AP/TS STATE/S BY NOW AND IN THE PROCESS SAVED EC9NOMY WORTH AT LEAST 60 THOUSAND CRORES. BUT DO YOU THINK THERE IS ANY MINISTER WORTH HIS/HER SALT AND HAS BARE MINIMUM KNOWLEDGE TO APPLY MIND ON THESE LINES AND ERADICATE CORONA? JUST IMAGINE WITH 12000 CRORE RUPEES WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN THE HUMAN RESOURCES THAT COUPD HAVE BEEN RECRUITED AND TRAINED AND PUT ON JOB ON THE CEM? WHAT K8ND OF CORONA ISO LATION AND QUARANTINE LEVEL 1 AND 2 INSTITUTIONAL CENTERS WOULD HAVE BEEN ORGANISED AND HOW MUCH IF CRITICAL CARE PRESSURE WOULD HAVE BEEN REDUCED AND HIW MANY PAID PRIVATE CORONA CENTERS WIULD HAVE BEEN FACILITATED? SO ECONOMIC WUSDOM IS ZERO AMONG POLITICIANS AND ANOTHER TRUTH IS THAT MANY MINISTERS DO NOT KNOW FIRST ALPHABET KNOWLEDGE FOR GET KNOWING ANY THING. || Madam Butterfly - He saw it coming because he had a hand in creating it...when did this man study science and become a Doctor... were supposed to listen to a man who wants to depopulate the world.. sounds like a nazi Doctor in my opinion... this man is a Sociopath... the world has woke up to these people only problem we have is the GATES OF HELL DOESNT REALISE IT YET... can't wait to see these people in a court of law for crimes against humanity....wasnt Bill Gates on Epsteins flight log after he was charged with Child Sex Abuse...ye save the world my arse.. abuse it more like in the name of a humanitarian.. || underyourskin - This is the result you get when you make wealthy people feel like gods...

For this particular problem

If we deactivate the independent sources then 2I & I would be same only in one case that is I=0 so open circuit the depended source too. Now only 2 resistances are in parallel 2ohms & 1 ohms So Rth is simply the parallel of 1&2 i.e 2/3ohm || ram 908 - Super sir excellent explanation || Mohan bhai ki padhai - nicely explained sir   thank you so much || Nikhil Tomar - R/2"

He is just a guy who sells soft and hardware, and who has lot of money. Why is he advising governments about health and vaccines ? Why should we listen to him and not to world recognized health specialists ? They told us from the beginning that 70% of people will anyway get in touch with the virus, and that 98% are gonna survive this. If we get the right medical equipments to take care of populations, it is just fine. We dont need to shut the world economy down. And why absolutely getting a vaccine for a virus thats constantly evolving ? || Scott King - CV 19 vs The Bill of Rights:

Should Humanity take the path of evolving into an extremely complex society (human super-organism) it must be well prepared to bear the burden imposed on its components; millions of cells die daily in the human body, yet we hardly empathize or even feel their plight while we enjoy their services. So Humanity, better prepare for millions of casualties as collateral damage in the service of this future human super-organism. || Jenova - China +80k = Total Lockdown

9:17 - In the Area of TESTING... || mad max - Of Course he knew it, he is the man who has vaccine prepared 20 years ago. It is a planned event and his vaccine is deadly. Just see the truth that is in your face, and do some research on Google 🙏 He is a sick psychopath. || Tatiane Silva - Gente coloquem a legenda em Português por favorrr, I LOVE Bill Gates ❤️ || The7287678 - All vaccines include toxic mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde, phenoxyethanol (antifreeze), and squalene adjuvants that weaken and can destroy the human immune system, making it vulnerable to many annoying to life-threatening illnesses.
Among other dangers, inoculated individuals will risk becoming ill from the coronavirus instead of being protected from infection by being vaxxed. || borderguyeh87 - Playstation is I better Billy lmao || xzero89 - it's easy to control the populus if the enemy is invisible. || E3 - Certificate Of Vaccine I D 19 = Chip in wrist = Patent Microsoft has for chip in wrist with Microsoft crypto currency = This is how governments are planning on fighting back against bitcoin and monero.

Look it up! || rudesoto - The government may benefit from watching YouTube || Demetris Jones - Bill gates is the devil || Stacey's Art Studio - I pray a rebuke against all the plans to kill and depopulate Gods creation in the name of Jesus Christ our Savior. || Rita Ariadna - He has for shure spanned his business! Maybe we could stop supporting Microsoft globally and feeding money to this supposed benefactor of mankind? || Brett Sloma - The exact words were ""digital immunity proof"".

You are really incompetent. || Taran Singh The Parolier - When bill gate came on screen , for a while I thought it's steven Hawkins.😱 but then I realized it's bill gates the man who predicted a pandemic. || SaRa 4Rheal - He's creepy.  Personally.... I have absolutely no trust in this man. and his intentions || Paulo Cortez - Hearing this feels like we're being played in ac0mputer game. || ramban321 - Why is he interested in Viruses and vaccines?  Who appointed him ? Why? What's in it for him? His DNA vaccine is a crime against Humanity. He belongs in jail. Now, before he wipes 1/2 of world population. || Juan Caceres Guerrero - 3:36 why did you edited it off? || Aparna Shakti - Corona virus has engulfed so many lives and is still   a deadly disease . What is your opinion || lisa K - He said most people survive this
Then he said we need vaccines to keep high fatalities down. || halley oey - need to know their internet provider for this smooth interview || B1G_BAZ - So when is Bill gates being arrested for crimes against humanity?? || Anna Firth - This is so over edited... Let him speak freely would you. || Hillel Flesch - Bill you are so, so happy ""humanitarian"". Your face is shining,  your smile goes around your head. Talking about the deaths of real people like they are characters in some video games. I've been here from the time before the Earth was made and witnessed all human deeds. I can tell you Billy, no matter how much you try YOU will finish your life like all people during history. There is no escape from the death no matter how much someone tries. No genetic research can save you. I follow you from the moment you were born. I know your secrets, your feelings, your deeds. I know when you lie,  when you are afraid (mostly all the time). Basically, no one loves you including your wife and kids. Your associates pretend that they appreciate you. Without money, you know deep down that you are nobody. Every time I see you I feel in my heart sad and sorry for you. I know all about you. I feel your unhappiness. Sometimes I even cry when I see how unhappy you are.  Do not try to ""help"" humanity because this is not your job. You do not own them. They can do better off without you. So be calm and wait your time to join the rest who had lived on this planet. I was told to say this like Moses was told to write his book. || jon webster - it had never occured to me that vaccines / antibodies are grown on various animal tissues and then injected into adults and in usa; babies. fcol. watch a real scientist talk like Mikovits or a real doctor like Buttar. || MonkeyspankO - Whats most shocking about all this is how few people appear to understand this sort of situation. Or to rephrase more appropriately, how MANY clearly don't understand || Fault Finder - TRIVIA: Is the Virus a ""MAN MADE"" by the result of the new elevated technology that's going on in the air that we cannot see in our own ""Naked Eye"" only a few who sees it and responsible for all of this...SPECULATING ONLY! It's all up to you to analyze and decide what it means.Thanks..! || gohn k - The elite are always trying to save the world. I thank you the elite for fixing world hunger and saving the children who are getting raped and trafficked almost everyday. Hopefully you succeed in your vaccinations and the microchip so you know we are vaccinated. And thank you for the 5g. I put my trust in you.

""Basically no"". || TheOrphicLyre - If the solution he's selling us works anything like as well as Windows does, I'd be very concerned. || Naňa Morenaňa - Doesn't anyone find it disturbing that bill gates is smiling and laughing through out the interview? There is nothing funny about the thousands of people loosing their lives because of a virus he and other evil scientist have created! || brucolerba - Why am i listening health advices from a billionaire without any health qualification and who btw has created the most virus infected operative system ever?! And why are you too ??? || Woken One - 34:14 Can't wait to get my Vacine Certificate ID yesss! Thank you daddy gates <3 || Paul Kossey - Bill Gates Talks About Injections WILL Lead to At Least Some BIG MISTAKES 1) There are 290 (!) BIG AND small countries and NOONE WANTS CORONAVIRUS INJECTIONS FOR CHILDREN 2) as You get older and smarter ITS UNPLEASANT to see An Coding Empire that an Always Modern OS it could be in different times BECOME A REALLY TINY PERCENTGE || Carl Kuss - What he says here makes a lot of sense. He should be given much credit as a humanitarian. I would still argue with him about eugenics, but I don´t see him as the Incarnation of Evil.  We don´t need scapegoats.  We don´t need nutty conspiracy theories. We have our hands full with reality at the moment. || Chris Pecherzewski - sounds so good huh?? it's all about CONTROL! Government  takeover for  depopulation.   I have a Constitutional Right not to be vaccinated   'it's my body it's my choice' stop the BS... learn from Korea?? I don't think so. Who is Bill Gates, now  an expert on a weak virus? This is all FEAR based. || gabrielle upton - Can someone PLEASE tell me how a college dropout has become the worlds leading health expert?? And How is it that without a medical license, Mr. Gates has been filmed administering immunizations without said license? I am certain that in order to act as a medically trained professional, one MUST be in possession of that REQUIRED MEDICAL LICENSE! || Yul Hubbart - BILL GATES IS KERMIT THE FRAUD. || Mrdruggedalien - Why is Bill laughing so much? does he see some money for the future in his labs,s? easy prediction in 2015 to set it up in the future? || komsya - what, if we create machines able to predict?



real-time event response technology

based on fog computations || terry walker - Bill Gates is a nutcase! || Paula Harris Baca - If Bill Gates thinks that the earth has too many people, which he apparently believes because he doesn't look at the empty regions of the world, why wouldn't he want to have a massive 1918 Spanish Flu epidemic (which I personally am glad about, or I wouldn't personally be here. My grandma's first husband and she both caught the Spanish Flu and he died, so she remarried my grandpa, who had my mom, and then I came along to consume Microsoft products) which would hopefully wipe out millions and millions of people. And each war we have kills off even more people. And of course, when you start packing Europe with huge quantities of people who aren't physically adapted to the climate and have completely different belief systems and cultures, you are causing huge masses additional consumption of goods in those countries who were at a nice, stable population level.   || Dr.Tanveer Ahmed, Ph.D - It is too astonishing and so undeniably amazing that such guys totally non-reliant, accompanied collectorate partner of Dijjali System, his team agenda depopulation is the invisible enemy to the rest of humanity's collapsing economies, boosting poverty enriched suicidal approaches and huge massive criminality causing huge flooded litigation further HBO disclosing inside total different story about Hybrid Seeds, GM Seeds, BT Seeds, and Super GM Seeds eliminated from this world pretty possessed patent from FDA/NHS co-ordinator, funder and the mastermind of such corona-virus, damn.devil1 {([you can save yourself and protect by spiritual meditation nourish your heart and soul via tranquility likewise])} this link is appropriate for your better consequences || Lando Polo - This is like a sequel for us who saw bill's 2015 talks due to the Youtube algorithm recommending it couple weeks ago. || Sounak Roy - Once again why would we listen to Bill Gates for a pandemic study/virology? What is his credentials?  Excuse my ignorance. || Soros Promnok - Very spotted on predictions back then and well informed of  a “how to”  now and it makes me just WOWwww, sire Bill..... || Plain - kinda Gates and Musk turned their outsider status in childhood into an evil allmighty powerful opposite. you are both loved, but please, go to Mars, and leave us alone. || Иван Елизаров - At first: take your part in creating the pandemy and making people fear.
At second: just suggest a digital vaccine.
Um, thank you, mr. Gates! || HiP CoLouR - 16:32 Bills face. You won't regret it || Olga Ismag - Why Ted talks interviews Bill Gates about VIRUSES? DO WE HAVE MEDICAL TRAINED DISEASE SPECIALIST IN US? it would be good when  ""shoemaker making shoes and the baker bake the bread"" 
Invite epidemiologist for those questions! || Nothing Less Than Epic - They create the problems then sell the solutions. || Remember to Love - Zika, Ebola, Sars and Mers (and COVID-19 as of 16.April 2020) are all PATENTED disease, that means they are MANMADE!!!!
Start thinking, they create the problem and now they are trying to force us to take their poison! || Bryan Ding - I definitely agree with Bill gates about being prepared for another virus but I disagree with him saying that nothing was done. First of all do you think that all of America or even the whole world watched the ted talk 5 years ago. I mean of course not. || bardownaint - Bills house looks like an airport. || WEAPONS_OFMASS DISTRACTION_71 - Do not rich men opress you, and draw you before the judgement seats? || Tim Kerstetter - He's so excited and loving it. I'll get him. 50 cal thermal sight. Second he farts above the temperature the pandemic is over. || Iwan Malinin - Thanks 😊 || Alejandro - 4:10

I TRUST billionaire Bill! || tarre tan - Wow Microsoft Teams™ seems like a great product for online conference and business communications || 7ruach9 - Does anyone notice he ahs as much as Trudeau does when he talks? Not good at all || Alexandro Betancourt - Bill Gates good luck chuck a huge finger will drop on your head .       Jesus still Loves you AMEN AMEN || Jester Infester - Fascinating! TED usually brings notable experts in a field to introduce new ideas. How does Bill Gates earn time for an advertisement on TED for the Coronavirus  when he developed one of the worst computer operating systems in history. I suppose he has a few extra $billion to share to use TED to lend an air of credibility or reliability to his opinions, banal as they are, to be heard more effectively. Isn’t that why no one listened to him the first time? I mean it must be great to be a multibillionaire and also have a foundation in which to hide $billions more. Still it doesn’t make him a virologist or Epidemiologist or even make him more convincing. Wasn’t the state he lives in one of the hardest hit on the west coast? Me thinks he has ulterior motives and this talk is more infomercial for his home test kit. Let’s see, scare the crap out of everyone around the globe with computer models that we now know were garbage, then run to the rescue and save the whole world with a home test for just $19.95. 🤑😷🙄 || Cecile Goforit - Why did he say in 2010 then we could reduce population number thanks to vaccines, Health Care and Reproductive Health Services? 
Isn't it contradictory to want to ""save lives"" today when 10 years before he litterally said we could lower population by 10/15%? || Armando Ideas - One thing he didn't took, is: we have to pick better leaders, not just clowns that make us laugh. || guloguloguy - IMHO: This ""deadly, MAN-MADE, ""BIO-WEAPON"" (COVIDvirus), looks like it has been designed to kill older, weaker people, essentially culling those ""useless eaters"" that NAZIs sought to eliminate.... || Jean Dziadosz - I just remembered, my doctor Ive had for 10 years suddenly started doing ""drug screening"" with a swab kit. Why are they wanted everyone's DNA on file?🤔 || pathfinderdaddy - Shame on TED
Totally discredited || Silverback OR - what about the virus you tried to sell to the US government?  how did that go.  seems very similar to the parameters that were set out in your BUG. HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU make on this current ""issue""? || A punk Daydream - Lamunan Oi! - 25:03 Correcting Bill Gates on a number, how must that feel... || natija08 - The Spanish flu was so deadly because there was a war in Europe (1914-18), many poeple didn't have enough and very little healthy things to eat because they were poor or the economy was so down. I read that many US-soldiers got the Spanish flu, BECAUSE they were vaccined. Our immune system is made to fight any virus. It only needs Vit. C, Vit. D and zinc. The Corona-virus is not as dangerous as Bill Gates wants to tell us. He only wants to earn a lot of money from all of his investments in pharmaceutical companies. Therefore his plan is to vaccine the whole mankind - and - because the corona-virus as an RNA-virus mutates so quick - he will earn a lot of money every year. Sweden is an example that a shutdown isn't necessary. China isn't a democracy. || Dcode Moon - I think these chips are about to watch people who are seeking about Quantum computers because they are the most scary thing and Bill Gates is already into computers we all know that..... || JackieChan 4525 - I’m not gonna trust someone who wants to vaccinate every one with no choice. He also supports the World Healy organization, who is a communist. || citizenY - Do not trust this man. || Awwab Abdelrazig - What we have all been waiting for . . . || Leonard Patty - Lot of stupid people here, i can see tht || Camp Literature_ ជំរំបណ្ណាល័យសាស្ត្រ - Stay safe!! || Christopher George - Interestingly, Gates is related to the Rockefeller's on his mothers side. His father worked for Planned Parenthood. He was raised to fulfill this role. || cynthia g - Bill is smiling about people concerned about not being able to work and crashing the economy!!!  Smiling........yep, Bill, we know you don't worry about that. || Michael JW - 34:35 When Bill was asked whether or not his foundations are involved in manufacturing the test kits, the answer gets cut out || Manuel Blanquel - So through this ""digital immunity proof"" Goverment is going to determine if im healthy or not ? If i can go anywhere or do anything?                                               So im guessing that immune systems and freedom are out of the table.                 I cant understand why Bill became “the expert” on public health policy and they keep asking for his opinion. Very very suspicious || Ivan Juarez - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_NLAnm7bCY

CV is NOT scary for me at all. || Lin White - you are not a doctor, Bill, nor an expert || K C - Mr. Gates, a few weeks before my dad passed away he had visions and went back-n-forth from this reality to the other side and brought back some interesting information.  One thing was that he unwittingly predicted an event that would happen to me.  The thing was, he thought that it had already happened and was asking me about it.  I didn't know what to think and told him no that hasn't happened to me, but I wrote it down how he described it.  And lo and behold, it came true about 10 months later!  Just the way he saw it!  In one of his other visions, he saw you, Mr. Gates.  Yep he saw you.  He first said that you were Lucifer, then he corrected himself and said ""no no Bill Gates isn't Lucifer but he's a lot like him, evil like Lucifer"" - Mr. Gates its coming out.  What are you going to do now?  My dad isn't the only one.  Lots of others are figuring out the kind of person you are.  What are you going to do Mr. Gates?

The young doctor in Wuhan  that called out about, the virus, was then SHUT Down! Then he died! Others died too! So this must have been happening maybe in 2018 for the WHO to be alerted; there must have been many dying before GOVERNMENT alerted the people.  || Tennessee Honey - OK, SO THE FDA HAS ALREADY APPROVED COMPUTER CHIP FOR HUMANS.

It's because he planned this. Gates helped create this pandemic. Gates funded the Wuhan lab where the virus was released and then spread around the globe. 63,000 Americans died of the flu in 2019. No shut downs, nothing. Now all of a sudden, the government is so concerned about the lives of the older population they're going to tank the economy? Wake up. This is about power. This about control. || Rohit Pai - Wow, basically an online ted talk! || dekdek nav - Bill Gates should enjoy the remaining few years of his life. With all his billions he should be satisfied, leave the decisions to good, HONEST scientists.

The owner of Windows, would know a thing or two about viruses 🦠 || Raj Kirpalani - The disruption to knock it down is unprecedented because people like you do and your medical doctor friends are not educating the nation on health. I haven’t seen any word come out of your mouth that talks about nutrition and minerals and micronutrients ..but I do constantly hear your voice utter the words vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine.... || Margarita Orlova - Does Bill Gate still think that CO2 is poisonous? He did lately. || Facundo Lopez - I honestly believe this pandemic was an agreement amongst several of the leaders of the world to decrease population. Many leaders have shown their true colors now in this situation where all they care about is the exonomy and not human life. || Luba Mich - This is his conspiracy talking back from 2015, he didn't predicted then but rather plan it with his team to force vaccines and truck ppl movements with digital cards or maybe even chips, who knows.

We aren’t ready” from 2015? || Viking - Why on Earth would or should we let the ""elites"" destroy our lives and the planet?  For cash payments? Avarice does not equate to competence nor altruism. || Conner Cook - At the risk of sounding ignorant, why are they interviewing a computer programmer and builder about a medical pandemic? || Robocop2015 - Bill doesn’t have access to his hairstylist. || Sss Fff - Such bull!

Thanks.. || Devlins10 - Agendavirus 2020 || 7livesful - Right  at 34:14, Gates talked about how he sees things rolling out from there.

Eventually what we’ll have to have is certificates of who’s a recovered person, who’s a vaccinated person... || Paul Kossey - Bill Gates Oh what a fun INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT Math and Algebraic Algorithms for Application and core and NETWORK ABSTRACTION to Lead Reputation of USA and Europe TO FIGHT some DECADE for vaccinations when theres Really No Evidence Children Need That  how do you think || brutal - READ THIS FOR THE EVIL TRUTH OF BILL GATES VACCINES:


Bill Gates took control of India’s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) which mandated up to 50 doses (Table 1) of polio vaccines through overlapping immunization programs to children before the age of five. Indian doctors blame the Gates campaign for a devastating non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP) epidemic that paralyzed 490,000 children beyond expected rates between 2000 and 2017. In 2017, the Indian government dialed back Gates’ vaccine regimen and asked Gates and his vaccine policies to leave India. NPAFP rates dropped precipitously. || Patachon Patachon - Check out what he did in India. || Elizabeth V - Bill gates is evil. He likely helped fund the creation of this virus. He said years ago he wants to depopulate (I agree) but what better way that a virus that kills old and sick people!? He also thanked people of wuhan for their sacrifice. He is sick and will answer to god. When that happens he will realize it is not him. He is not god || Zak Tripper - How do people believe in billionaire philanthropists? || Milena Ivanova - Are you sure he's not a scientist?!

Amazing. || James Butters - Sorry Bill, you're not a doctor and windows IS plagued with thousands of virus. Anyone see the pattern?  Gates is the last person i would trust with my health. PS. on a milder note, MS teams is buggy and has a poor user experience. || Yelir Milas - Bill Gates: just you wait guys, we can do better. || UK2AK - It's a very solid interview, however once in awhile I thought: how sad that so many people cannot even listen to this because their heads explode at the slightest suggestion that their politically motivated perspective could need calibrating in some spots. 🙁 || Teresa Belardes - What nobody's  mentioning here is that he and his cronies colluded with China to manipulate this virus || 都筑隆 - MORE THAN 10%PEOPLE ARE REALLY WAKING UP!! AIDS, SARS, ZIKA, EBOLA ARE ALL PATENTED. AND SO STRANGE THESE GUYS NEVER DISCUSS ABOUT IMMUNE SYSTEMS. || FREE THOUGHT - Gates is evil and you should never take his vaccine or micro chip.  His vaccines have killed and maimed thousands! || Mike Dittmer - Q: What people should you never take advice from on how to save lives in a pandemic
A: Those who believe the greatest threat to the planet is over-population || Luki Szuki - The only good news is you are going to jail mr Gates. || Andrey L - forget about vaccines, there is alternative boost your immune system, no need of vaccines, there is old traditional way for that, vaccines will kill you immune system, and of course it will kill you to the death, cause nobody will give you warranty once you get a vaccine you will be fine after 1 year, 5,10,50 years of living, and your DNA will not gonna be damage... || bernhard reck - 18 month is rather too fast and dangerous.. Honestly vaceen is not what's needed.. We need to look at what exactly contributes to the danger.. What type of nano particles in humans system and where do these particles come from..

EVERYBODY KNOWS || timothy armstrong - All essential workers should be tax exempt both federal and state. || Francis Castiglione - Where's the immune assisted nano bot tech that you bill gate(B=K) n darpa has been collaborated for years of the super soldier projects.......oh yeah its operated by windows os who got alot virus attack...yet....today weve got ccp ransomware called c0vid19.exe......lol. || Luciano Ottaviani - The truth is going to come out by someone that works for him. Karma always happens || Kaushik Kumar - How he predicted the future in his previous
Ted- talk video 🤔🤔.
Some researchers says -virus was created in the lab. 
is he behind this pandemic? || Michał Cyran - There is no SARS-CoV-2 virus. There is no pandemic. There is no need to respond. In fact, trying to think about how to respond is dangerous because then you are starting to believe in a lie and are part of it. Think about God. Think about him first. || Alejandra Cadiz - I would like to know when testing will be widely available for the people and not just for politicians, actors and the wealthy... || Elisa Dach - Ask India how damaging Bill's polio venture has been. || Frani Dance - Don't be fooled by this guy. Mr Silicone Valley/Medicine Man has a different agenda to what we are being lead to believe. For honest, intelligent and REAL news about this pandemic, check out UK Column News. || tim styiener styiener - BILL GATES IS GOING TO PRISON REAL SOON || fam alam - BILL GATES A VERY EVIL MAN : MAKING BILLIONS THROUGH COVID TESTING KITS AND WANTS TO MAKE FURTHER VIA THE VACCINES!! NOBODY SHOULD TAKE THE VACCINE, IT KILLS. watch Dr. BUTTAR AND Dr Shiva for real truth || Storm Shaddo - The biggest danger of this virus are the Machiavellian globalists (like Gates) who will try to take advantage of the crisis to impose their new Orwellian technocratic order on the whole world. || whatever gumgum - We can responding to it by not listening to a guy that openly admits to reducing population with vaccines. The guy that had to change the name of his institution: ""Bill and Melinda Gates Institution for Population Control"" || You Wish - This is not your business, you're not an elected official, go away. || Garrett May - Bill is not a MD... || Mortgages by Sarah Colucci - Always listen to the richest man in the world about his opinions on vaccines - a business he's created. - and who doesn't have any medical experience and is not a doctor.

Get rid of Bill Gates 😁 || Al - Almost five years ago on April 3, 2015, Bill Gates said: ""We are not ready for the next Epidemic"". || Joe - I don’t believe in religion or any conspiracy theory for that matter, but I’m convinced some governments are going to use the virus as a way to take rights from people. Many are seeing it as a seizable opportunity to have greater control over the public. I’m certain the SARS-Cov2 virus is natural , but the way the world has responded is indeed unnatural. || mary silva - Is this guy is expert in technology so he should create a free anti-virus for computer programs not for humans bodies!😤 || Steven Brown - Gee Bill what are we going to do today....The same thing we do every day try to depopulate the world.Naaarrf. || Big P - Bill is totally out the gate, period!

Is Hillary the great great great grand daughter of Lolith? Not just because she eats babys or has people killed! || peter dochev - As soon as it is possible for the authorities to declare any contagious virus a deadly epidemic and a mandatory quarantine for the whole society, it will be possible to introduce a mandatory immunization and an immunization passport. It must be said that this is fascism, aggression against human nature and existence. There are no such epidemics in nature, they are the fruit of sick brains with sick fantasies or big fraudulent intentions. || Donald Quirk - Hey Bill Gates here is your digital certificate 🖕 || Sound of Gugu - As an after thought.. Gates is Dr Evil? (Austin Powers) “1 Trillion Dollars!” || Robbie Craughwell - They say psychopaths hide in open site! || Mark Arnold - The overwhelming majority of farmed animals are kept in dark, unsanitary, overcrowded factory farms, which stresses their immune systems. Worse, they’re bred primarily for rapid growth and maximum output, not robustness, and their genetic similarity makes them especially likely to transmit disease to one another. || AsA INNOVARE - COVID-19 is actually are EXOSOMES not a Virus that invades your body but it is the reaction of real cause of illness generated inside our Respiratory illness caused production of exosomes which induces Poison, electromagnetic radiation (5G), stress (fear), Toxic substances, Ionizing radiation, Infection, Injury, Immune response, Asthma, Diseases.  || P A - Liar liar || Victoria Love - Why is Bill Gates such a pharmaceutical pusher?

So vile , I guess he's trying to managing the hate he's receiving . || Needful Things Company - He owns the patent on the vaccine which will not work on a mutating virus!  Gates other vaccines for 3rd world countries have killed, sterilized, and paralyzed Babis, children, women & men. He has gotten off for these crimes because e of loophole laws for pharmaceutical companies not being held responsible for. He is for world depopulation! His wife wears an upside down cross. Says lots to the world! Not to be trusted look what he did to his partners to get ahead. Sold out to evil of mankind! Twisted can’t even make this up! Has been working with China, And others. || Michigan Bassin - Funny how some guy with no medical background whatsoever thinks he knows what he’s talking about don’t listen to bill gates || cherrynewideas - He's been to Epstein's island, can't be trusted. || rich deering - Yeshua’s (Jesus’s real name), words only.... “it’s easier for a camel 🐫 to tho go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.” || Peta Bindoff - Know the '' truth ''.. and no matter what you say.

Same is the case this being used by Migraine patients. This has been tried by many patients with excellent results. Why not do research on this Mudra Yoga. Similarly practicing Pran Mudra and Varun Mudra. || honey dew - love this, it's so interesting listening to Bill Gates talk about this || My Will - Greatest darkest mind || Enver Gökce - Der Billi Boy gehört hinter Schloss und Riegel. || Android Gamer - He appears quite friendly, benign and harmless, doesn't he? Psychopaths often do. This man is the devil in disguise. Say NO to his vaccine. || frosty frostys - who is this again ? || Vishnu Sasidharan - WHEN WILL TED TALK?? || BeStiLL&KnOw - Your pile of bodies have a cure!!! Why won’t you tell the world of the cure!!! It’s available and has been for 70 years!! Hydrochloriquine and Zpac!

Shut down so you can take over the world... one world order, one world currency, a chip to track everyone.. Mark of the Beast! || Gordon Law - Your vacation will not be taken!! || Linda J. S. Anderson - The bible says keep your enemies close. He is smart and rich so everybody would rather knock him down. That's the a American way.  When in fact we need to know he is putting word out and possibly because we are suppose to be told or fore warned. Which we Americans have to much to do instead of paying attention. It's our fault we ignored the signs because we were weak. We were to busy being on top to worry about what's going on below. Which brings to mind our military. Do we really live so high above that we in the eye's of other countries are just letting military handle it handle it. We were made from God and Earth. Which makes Earth Mother Earth.  We should be down to Earth not trying to be better than our Father (GOD). || Weird Cell - Did he say ""I told you so""? || Ken Side - I really liked the questions the interviewer covered:
- even tho China is starting to operate as normal again, is it really believable that the virus is not still circulating around? 
- why did governments fail to act faster? || Samuel Ma - Thank you. Mr. Gates. || Tiago Ribeiro - Don't ever take a vaccine created or finnanced from this guy. || I agree too. - The amount of Karens here in this comment section is so sad.. || hamish r - The Chinese are not a credible source of information. .they do not care about the billions of disposable citizens...they are already blaming this outbreak on foreigners...and of course you will never be aware of the real stats || joe moonblue - this is a live exercise to stress test systems , in preparation for the next virus || We Love Hugs - A better title of this video would be:  how can Bill Gates control all the people who are being misled about a virus that has one goal: to cause a TOTAL CONTROL WORLD SYSTEM ! || Scott Auctions - Ask Gates if he and his family will be ""VACCINATED"" || Ejay Emm - Bill Gates is a ""health expert"" yall 🙄 I didn't know drop outs were qualified to force vaccinations on people || Vincent Blake - Devil || Scott Campbell - It’s not just the ventilators you need the personnel to go along with them || Perseverance - Its Dr Death!

Companies will be indemnified against infected vaccines but people won’t be. Apparently, according to his doctor, neither Bill nor his family have had vaccines. B4B. More billions from selling vaccines for Bill. || humphrey javu - Event 201 || Alan Wilson - there is a very obvious ""tell tale"" sign that bill is lying....... his lips move || kmp1066 - He warned about a pandemic because he helped to create it!!! He's a weird evil man. || Altair Anjilo N de Almeida - In all this talk of 'helping people', nowhere did he say or suggest the very simple, very cheap ways to boost the immune system to reduce risks of getting the infection. So when people say this man has Humanity improvement as his goal, I am very suspicious. There's Vit D, Sunlight (FREE!), Vit C, eating well (NOT EATING JUNK FOOD AND SUGAR). That's simple info. NO TRACE! Only his mission to create vaccines, and to force everyone to have them. This is already law in Germany for future workers to have a certificate of vaccination or no job! He stands to make $45 Billion if everyone is vaccinated. Not bad for his $1Billion investment in 7 Vaccine drug creators. No, sorry I don't buy it. Too many questions and very dubious answers. || Musiclover - Gates is evil. We thought he was just a nerdy guy who wants to help the world.   Now will you look at him again?  He must be stopped, with his friend's of course || Black Gold - Notice that the media isnt mentioning 'chinas draconian measures' anymore because they will soon emforce it globally. || Lars D - ""We are trying..."". We? Who has elected him to run our society? || Anthonyleegmc - Who also watches this video because of wanting to learn something new during this COVID 19 as I do 😂? || oskar oskarssson - first question ted asking sounds like its peoples fault when the virus in this case was created by Bill himself together with Anonymous World leaders || Salvador Ramirez - I think we're desperate if we have TECH people fight the ""VIRUS"" || Chunk - We all have a lot of time on our hands so after this please look in to ID2020 and one world order  and Bill Gates || hamish r - Most Americans can't understand anything they can't see. ..too complicated || Ram K Krishnan - This guy wanted to reduce the fertility rate of people .. THIS IS HIS CHANCE ... OR DID HE CREATE THIS CHANCE ????? || Tennessee Honey - Bill Gates Is Using The Pandemic To Chip Us. It Will Blow Up In His Face! || Luis Alvarado Cruz - This conference is very interesting, as it explain the information about the virus that is killing millions of people || James Rubiolo - 34:40 he asks if bills foundation is helping w the vaccines and then they cut it. Wonder what that was about || adriano 1488 - kill bill 3 uma turman chopped his head off , || SLIDINGINTOIT - THEY HAVE NOT isolated a virus, they are NOT testing for a virus, and they are NOT concocting ""vaccines"".....WAKE UP. || Gabriela D. - This is the ""I told you so"" video? || lovepeacebliss - gates has financial ties to john hopkins, who ""tracks"" global data. Hes creating the fear and offering the solution. || Jake Williams - 34:39 Why did you cut out the part where Gates says, ""So eventually there will be this digital immunity proof that will help facilitate the global reopening up.""
?????????????????????????????????????????????
That's a pretty monumental statement by Gates. What are you hiding, TED? || Jack Zhang - Reading all the comments, it amazed me how many anti-intellectual people the US has. The US needs to work harder on its education. || Esther Weichman - why are we asking Bill Gates as if he is some medical expert? || claumonas - What happened with the accusation of financing illegal vaccination of thousands of girls in India, causing damage in them and in some cases even death ? || Darren Wu - This guy has been fighting viruses since Windows 95. || Javier Borda - He’s done his exponencial calculations  for sure || cynthia g - Chris Anderson is asking all the best questions.  Great host!! || Ekaterina Bogdanova - Biology is not that simple like business or computer science. Why do people say bad things about the scientist? WTF!? It's not only money. It's also time... || terryberry28 - BILL... YOU ARE NOT A DOCTOR or a scientist at all... || Профессор Преображенский - A vaccinated dog with a chip is an animal of a person, a vaccinated person with a chip is an animal of Bill Gates, Bill Gates is an animal of the devil. the beast of gates brings the prophecy from Revelation John 13:15, including for atheists. If they come true, then the prophecies in chapter 14: 9 will come true. For those who apply his vaccine with a digital certificate to their bodies, they will go to eternal torment. || Marcos Mimenza - Money, philanthropy, modeling a threat simulation, spreading it among politicians, that's how the present was inspired. || solarmanhawaii - Loves how he speaks of ""Testing"" ...

It will literally be an extinction event that we change. I’m an Aussie and our politics is a shamble, funding all the wrong things. Beginning to be less proud day by day || CamShaft - كام شافت - This dude wants everything || rabbit uchiha - Jones was right. His “nelly” image is a facade. Just like most psychopath  murderers who go undetected for a long time, he purposely creates an image of himself to be philanthropic, helpful, endearing with his nerd-like charm, while in reality inside he’s sinister and sadistic. What a truly evil man. || Gemini Flower - Wait, he believes China’s numbers? He is the only person who is praising them because they arrested the doctor who tried to warn everyone. Also China let their citizens fly around the world spreading it everywhere. Why is he smiling so much, this is affecting everyone badly and so he shouldn’t be so happy. || paul horvath - why is  he always laughing when talking about death || T C - Pretty clear to say he's a part of the big boys club now. || Amanda Owens - it's highly fatal/dangerous to baby boomers.... let's be honest, that's why the US is shutting down. || Dora Tsolakis - Isn't this guy a computer geek??? When did this guy become a doctor to advise people on viruses.... seriously !!! || NIAMKE Venance - Ok, Doctor Bill. I see. The Testing for rich countries and the vaccine for impoverished countries. Africa Shall Rise, Yes We Shall || Jason Firewalker - The ""detoxifying"" foot bath advertisement preceding this does nothing to lend credibility to the vital content. || Odnaleziona w czasie - 32:05 In Great Poland they collects the blood plasma of people who have recovered from COVID-19 and gives it to the sick. People who have recovered eagerly donate their plasma three times at intervals. || Dirk de Graaf - 51:49 /51: 51 What happens? || David Paul - That's a beautiful Vista you've got there Bill. || ishmam rahman - If he makes a medicine or a vaccine he is going make a monopoly business and make huge money... thats why he is so happy || Chuck P [again and again] - Why did TED edit out some of what this bozo said?

This pandemic: Everyone knows this could have happened and it happens every 10 years or so.
